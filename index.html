                      <p> The pollution and debt are linked by the economists of
                        the richest by focusing mainly on the effectiveness of

                      <p> As we, the labor and environment are the neglected
                        remainder for those economists aiming or expecting
                        destruction, wars and kind of massive population
                        'dilution' (as they put it), while still able to ignore
                        the necessity for global inclusive social
                        beneficialness, being measured by systemic distribution

                      conditional feeling in group belongingness, which is
                      destructively tested by something like "how well do they
